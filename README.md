Distraction Free Facebook Chat
=======================

<b>This extension hides everything on Facebook except for chat</b>

<p>This simple extension allows you to show and hide Facebook UI elements (currently the top blue bar and the global container - newsfeed, profiles, etc.) so you can chat without the distraction of everything else.</p>

<p>Note: names are hidden in extension screenshots for safety of those shown. The extension does not hide the names of those you are chatting with or in your friend list. That would be silly.</p>
